# Starting Autonomous Coding for AI Refinery Enrichment

## Approach

Since claude-loop integration has path issues, I'll start autonomous implementation directly using best practices:

### Week 1 Implementation Plan (5 Days)

**Day 1-2: Distiller Framework**
- Implement YAML config loader
- Create orchestrator with intelligent routing
- Add task decomposition
- Implement executor dictionary pattern

**Day 3-4: Agent Library (Priority Agents)**
- SearchAgent
- ResearchAgent
- AnalyticsAgent  
- PlanningAgent
- BaseSuperAgent

**Day 5: Knowledge System Foundation**
- LanceDB integration
- Knowledge graph structure
- Basic RAG implementation
- Document processing

## Starting Implementation

I'll implement each story using Test-Driven Development:
1. Write tests FIRST (RED phase)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN phase)
3. Refactor for quality (REFACTOR phase)
4. Quality gates: tests, types, lint

## Progress Tracking

I'll create commits for each user story completion and provide regular progress updates.
